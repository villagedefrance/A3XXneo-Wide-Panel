===========================


This package contains:
----------------------
- A New Airbus A321 wide panel (1280 x 768)
- An updated Airbus A321 Default panel (1024 x 768)
- An updated Airbus A330 Virtual cockpit (VC)


-----------------
 INTRODUCTION
-----------------
I was working on an Airbus A330-900 neo project and wanted to use the default VC.
While looking into the panel files, I quickly realised that some updates were needed.
I searched online for better panels but none of them were up to the job, so I then 
decided to rework the FSX Default A321 panel, with the better TomA333NG_interior VC.
I also went on to make a wider 1280 pixels version of the default panel in the
process, because most of us have wide aspect ratio monitors nowadays.


-----------------
 FEATURES V1.0
-----------------
New background panel wide bitmaps (day and night).
New VC Camera views including Autopilot (centered) and Jumpseat. See Installation.txt file.
New VSpeed popup gauge using Aircraft weight, Flaps position and Barometric pressure.
New Ground Handling popup gauge with Fuel truck call, Doors control and Pushback.
New fully working Auto-brake switch, based on POSKY Auto-brake gauge.
New fully working Auto-taxi switch, to maintain 15 knots taxiing speed.
New Brake pressure gauge for the wide 2D panel.
New extended Cockpit Sounds gauge.

Fixed Warning/Caution buttons to display properly.
Fixed Flap Transit and Auto Brake lights. Now working correctly.
Fixed EICAS 2 screen, added missing fuel used and made available in 2D panel.

Updated MFD to support Terrain and Traffic (TCAS).
Updated Head-up Guidance System (HGS) popup to support wide screen.
Updated Altitude Callout gauge with Airbus A330 correct parameters.


-----------------
 COMPATIBILITY
-----------------
This panel is designed for FSX, FSX acceleration and FSX Steam Edition.
It is a complete replacement for any aircraft using the default A321 VC.
It has been tested on the default A321 and the SAAD A330-900 neo.
Most features should work just fine in P3D up to P3D v3. However,
some features (such as sound effects) may not work in P3D v4/v5.
