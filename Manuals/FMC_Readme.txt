Please do not contact me with questions on how to install guages.
There are several programs that do tis, and alot of info on how to do it
manually. Search is your friend.

Please read the manual before emailing with questions on how to operate the FMC.
Its a very simple FMC, and experimentation will teach you alot. =)
If its a button, it was meant to be pushed.

Enjoy!!
